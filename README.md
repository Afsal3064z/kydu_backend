# Kydu :: Node.js Backend

**Kydu** is a mobile application built as an online platform where anyone can post "gigs" requesting assistance with a variety of tasks such as personal aid, relocation, delivery, handyman services, and more. Others users close by have the opportunity to accept these gigs in exchange for a monetary reward.

This repository contains the Node.js backend for the application written using TypeScript. [Express](https://expressjs.com/) was chosen due to it's simplicity and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) was used as the database of choice because of the built-in support for working with Geospatial data, which the application heavily relies on to query location based data.
